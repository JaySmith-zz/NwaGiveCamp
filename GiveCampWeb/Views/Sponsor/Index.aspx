                        Founded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the recognized world leader in pizza delivery.
                        Domino's is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "DPZ." Through its primarily locally-owned
                        and operated franchised system, Domino's operates a network of 9,169 franchised
                        and Company-owned stores in the United States and over 60 international markets.
                        The Domino's Pizza(R) brand, named a Megabrand by Advertising Age magazine, had
                        global retail sales of over $5.6 billion in 2009, comprised of nearly $3.1 billion
                        domestically and over $2.5 billion internationally. During the third quarter of
                        2010, the Domino's Pizza(R) brand had global retail sales of nearly $1.4 billion,
                        comprised of over $747 million domestically and nearly $650 million internationally.
                        In June 2010, Pizza Today, the leading publication of the pizza industry, named
                        Domino's its "Chain of the Year" - making the company a two-time winner of the honor,
                        which it previously received in 2003. Domino's has expanded its menu significantly
                        since 2008 to include Oven Baked Sandwiches and BreadBowlPasta(TM), and in 2009
                        debuted its 'Inspired New Pizza' - a permanent change to its hand-tossed product,
                        reinvented from the crust up with new sauce, cheese and garlic-seasoned crust.

        As a GiveCamp sponsor, your support helps bring together all of the volunteers and
        developers that are working towards creating web applications for the selected non-profit
        organizations. Sponsors are an important part of ensuring that non-profits continue
        to benefit from this valuable work with no cost to participate. It will take more
        than the passion and expertise of our volunteers to make this happen. We need your
        support to help provide a fun and rewarding environment for our volunteers and developers.
    </p>
    <p>

        developers throughout the event weekend, software to be used in web site development,
